# WDI Project Two

# Dive Down - Dive sites of the world

## Goal:

To create a RESTful multipage website which would allow users to review SCUBA diving sites from around the world. To accomplish this, I was tasked at using the technologies and methods that I had learned during the first 5 weeks of the WDI course at General Assembly.

## Users should be able to:

> - Log in
> - View an index of dive sites
> - View a show page for each dive site
> - Create a new site
> - Edit a site
> - Delete a site
> - Leave comments/reviews for a site

# Approach

I approached this project with the idea of having a simple site that would allow users to view, create, edit, delete and comment on dive sites.
I planned to do this before starting on tasks such as authorisation or commenting, as it would allow me a solid base to build on and hit the majority of points for MVP.

The major blocker in this project was the use of EJS, as I had only been working with it for a week so I spend a lot of time researching the technology and finding solutions as and when they occurred.

## To do:

The app was originally built mobile-first, as this is what most users would interact with the site on in real life. Due to the deadline being moved forward by 2 days, I was unable to complete the styling and therefore had to make a quick desktop version for delivery. I will update the styling for this once I have time.
